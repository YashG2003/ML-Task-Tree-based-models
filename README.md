1. What is a Decision Tree ? How does it work ?
Decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm (having a predefined target variable) that is mostly used in classification problems. It works for both categorical and continuous input and output variables. We split the sample into two or more homogeneous sets based on most significant splitter / differentiator in input variables.
